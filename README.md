# 1 The analysis based on football matches dataset provides high-level summarizations and make predictions based on
the findings of the analysis.

## 1.1  Using Hadoop MapReduce
**1. The total number of matches played, ended with a result and drawn.**  
Code:&emsp;       MapReduce\src\main\java\bdpCW\TotalCount   
Execution:&emsp;  yarn jar MapReduce\target\mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bdpMP.TotalCount.TotalCount inputData/ output/totcount  
Output:&emsp;     hdfs dfs -cat output/totcount /part-m-00000  
Result:&emsp;     outputData\totalcount.txt  

Code:&emsp;       MapReduce\src\main\java\bdpMP\CountByOutcome\CountByOutcome.java  
Execution:&emsp;  yarn jar MapReduce/target/mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bdpMP.CountByOutcome.CountByOutcome inputData/ output/countOutcome  
Output:&emsp;     hdfs dfs -cat output/countOutcome/part-r-00000  
Result:&emsp;     outputData\countOutcome.txt  

**2. Total number of matches played in each city**  
Code:&emsp;       MapReduce\src\main\java\bdpMP\countbyCity\countbyCity.java  
Jar:&emsp;        mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  
Execution:&emsp;  yarn jar MapReduce/target/mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bdpMP.countbyCity.countbyCity inputData/ output/countbyCity  
Output:&emsp;     hdfs dfs -cat output/countbyCity/part-m-00000  
Result:&emsp;     outputData\countByCity.txt  

## 1.2 Using Pig 
**1. The total number of goals scored and conceded by each team when played home.**  

Code:&emsp;       Pig Script pig\home_perform.pig  
Execution:&emsp;  pig -x mapreduce  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;exec home_perform.pig  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;quit  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -ls /user/root/outputData/home_perf  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -get /user/root/outputData/home_perf/part-r-00000  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/resource/outputData/home_perf.txt  
Result:&emsp;outputData\home_perf.txt  

**2. Top 10 teams based on the average goals per match when played away.**  
Code:&emsp;       pig\top10.pig  
Execution:&emsp;  pig -x mapreduce  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;exec top10.pig  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;quit  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -ls /user/root/outputData/top10  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -get /user/root/outputData/top10/part-r-00000 /resource/outputData/top10.txt  
Result:&emsp;outputData\top10.txt  

**3. The 5 teams who have lost the most number of matches.**  
Code:&emsp;       pig\lost5.pig  
Execution:&emsp;  pig -x mapreduce  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;exec lost5.pig  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;quit  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -ls /user/root/outputData/lost5  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hdfs dfs -get /user/root/outputData/lost5/part-r-00000 /resource/outputData/lost5.txt  
Result:&emsp;     outputData\lost5.txt  



## 1.3 using Spark 
1. Percentage of countries that have hosted more than one type of tournament.  
2. Histogram of the total number of matches played overtime in year granularity.  
3. The total number of matches won, lost, and drawn by each team.  

# 2 Performing Machine Learning model using Spark MLlib
Model that predicts if a given team will win or lose the match given the rival and the
venue. (e.g., predict who will win if Argentina plays against Brazil at Milan, Italy). Use 80% of
the data for training and 20% of the data for validation. Clearly state the steps youâ€™ve
followed for your analysis
